Send local commits to the remote repository. Git push requiers two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.

Usage:

$ git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>

# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push -all

In Practice:

# Push a specific branch to a remote with named remote
$ git push origin staging
