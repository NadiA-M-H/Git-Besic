Git Checkout is uses to switch branches to work on different branches.

Usage:

# Checkout an existing branch
$ git checkout <branch_name>

# Checkout and create a new branch with that name
$ git checkout -b <new_branch>

In Practice:

# Switching to branch 'new_feature'
$ git cheackout new_feature
Switched to branch 'new_feature'

# Creating and switching to branch 'staging'
$ git checkout -b staging
Switched to a new branch 'staging'
