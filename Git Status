Git Status returns the current state of the repository /current working branch/ if a file is in the staging area, but not commited.

Usage:

$ git status

In Practice:

# Message when files have not been staged (git add)
$ git status
On branch SecretTesting
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..."to include in what will be  commited)
  
     homepage/index.html
     
# Message when files have been not been commited (git commit)
$git status
On branch SecretTesting
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/SecretTesting'.
Changes to be committed:
    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    
      new file:   homepage/index.html
      
# Message when all files have been staged an committed
$ git status
on branch SecretTesting
nothing to commit, working directory clean
